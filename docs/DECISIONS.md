### 2026-09-27 — Pin local venv to Python 3.11 via Homebrew

**Decision:** Installed `python@3.11` via Homebrew (`/usr/local/opt/python@3.11`)
and recreated `.venv` with that interpreter, matching the `>=3.11,<3.12` pin in
`pyproject.toml`.

**Why:** The system Python was 3.13, which is outside the Fixed stack's pin
(§8). Installing `python@3.11` required first updating Xcode Command Line
Tools (26.2 → 26.6), which needed the user's own admin auth and was done by
the user, not this session.

**Alternatives considered:** Relaxing the pyproject.toml Python pin to allow
3.13; using pyenv instead of Homebrew.

**Consequences:** `.venv` now resolves to Python 3.11.16. `pytest` and
`pre-commit run --all-files` both re-verified passing under it.
